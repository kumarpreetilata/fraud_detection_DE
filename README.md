# Real-Time Fraud Detection System

## Project Overview

The Real-Time Fraud Detection System is an end-to-end data engineering and machine learning pipeline designed to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. This project leverages various Azure services, including Azure Data Lake, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Synapse Analytics, along with machine learning algorithms to identify and mitigate fraud effectively.

## Features

- Real-time ingestion of transaction data via Azure Event Hubs.
- Data storage and processing using Azure Data Lake and Azure Databricks.
- Fraud detection model training using historical transaction data.
- Model deployment as a RESTful API using Flask.
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring for all processes.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Real-Time Fraud Detection System consists of the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: 
   - Data is ingested from various sources, including CSV, JSON, XML files, and real-time events from Azure Event Hubs.

2. **Data Transformation**: 
   - Data is processed and transformed using Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks.

3. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Relevant features are extracted and engineered for model training.

4. **Model Training**: 
   - A machine learning model is trained using the processed data.

5. **Model Deployment**: 
   - The trained model is deployed as a REST API using Flask, allowing for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Azure Services**: 
  - Azure Data Lake, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Synapse Analytics

- **Programming Languages**: 
  - Python

- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch, Flask, Azure SDKs

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Azure account with access to relevant services
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-system.git
   cd fraud-detection-system




2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required packages:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up your Azure credentials and configurations. Create a azure_credentials.json file and update it with your Azure service details.
